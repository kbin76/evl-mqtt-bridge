config.json
-----------

Under "evlConfig", the following two must be enabled (set to true):
		"proxyenable" : true,
		"atomicEvents" : true,



JSON output MQTT Topic

	To have all events (as supported by nodealarmproxy) issued as JSON on MQTT topic, 
	add the following definition under "evlConfig":
	"eventAsJSONTopic": "home/alarm/jsonEvt"
	(where you of course can set the topic name to whatever you like)
	All types of events will be issued under the same topic.

	Example of JSON output, it will look something like this:
	{"evtType":"partitionUpdate","partition":1,"code":"656","status":"exitdelay"}
	{"evtType":"partitionUpdate","partition":1,"code":"655","status":"disarmed"}
	{"evtType":"partitionUpdate","partition":1,"code":"650","status":"ready"}
	{"evtType":"zoneUpdate","zone":1,"code":"609","status":"open","zoneLabel":"LARM_EP-Huvudentre"}
	{"evtType":"partitionUpdate","partition":1,"code":"651","status":"notready"}
	{"evtType":"zoneUpdate","zone":1,"code":"610","status":"openrestore","zoneLabel":"LARM_EP-Huvudentre"}
	{"evtType":"partitionUpdate","partition":1,"code":"650","status":"ready"}
	{"evtType":"systemUpdate","code":"840","status":"troubleledon","partition":1}

	TODO: provide complete JSON schema, now you have to look in source code or perform some 
	tests to look at the JSON yourself.


Boolean output MQTT Topic

	This mode of operation uses only "boolean" MQTT topics, where it publishes a simple
	on/off as value to various topics. All topics shares the same base topic configured
	under "mqtt" like this (where "house/alarm/bool" is the base topic):
		"booleanEventTopic": "house/alarm/bool",

	The following topics are defined:
		Zones
			<base-topic>/z<zid>_open				Zone is open
			<base-topic>/z<zid>_alarm				Zone is in alarm
			<base-topic>/z<zid>_fault				Zone is faulty
			<base-topic>/z<zid>_tamper				Zone has been tampered with
			(<zid> is substituted with zone id)

		Partitions
			<base-topic>/p<pid>_ready				Partition is ready to arm
			<base-topic>/p<pid>_armed				Partition is armed
			<base-topic>/p<pid>_stayarm				Partition is stay-armed
			<base-topic>/p<pid>_awayarm				Partition is away-armed
			<base-topic>/p<pid>_inalarm				Partition is in alarm (BURGLAR/FIRE etc)
			<base-topic>/p<pid>_exitdelay			Partition is in exit delay mode
			<base-topic>/p<pid>_entrydelay			Partition is in entry delay mode
			<base-topic>/p<pid>_busy				Partition is busy (does not seem to work?)
			<base-topic>/p<pid>_chimeenabled		Chime functionality enabled
			<base-topic>/p<pid>_trouble				Partition trouble LED is on (any kind of trouble)

			<base-topic>/p<pid>_autoarming*
			<base-topic>/p<pid>_failedtoarm*
			<base-topic>/p<pid>_keypadlockout*
			<base-topic>/p<pid>_functionnotavailable*
			<base-topic>/p<pid>_invalidaccesscode*
			<base-topic>/p<pid>_pgmoutputinprogress*
			<base-topic>/p<pid>_userclosing*
			<base-topic>/p<pid>_specialclosing*
			<base-topic>/p<pid>_partialclosing*
			<base-topic>/p<pid>_useropening*
			<base-topic>/p<pid>_specialopening*
			(<pid> is substituted with partition id)

			<base-topic>/p<pid>_u<uid>_userclosing*		User closing (by access code)
			<base-topic>/p<pid>_u<uid>_useropening*		User opening (by access code)
			(<uid> is substituted with numeric user id)

			( *=Since these are not of "status" nature that can represented by on/off,
			when such event occur, first an "on" will be published and right after an "off",
			to more simulate an electrical "pulse")

		System
			<base-topic>/sys_service_is_required
			<base-topic>/sys_ac_power_lost
			<base-topic>/sys_telephone_line_fault
			<base-topic>/sys_failure_to_communicate
			<base-topic>/sys_sensor_or_zone_fault
			<base-topic>/sys_sensor_or_zone_tamper
			<base-topic>/sys_sensor_or_zone_low_battery
			<base-topic>/sys_loss_of_time


Zone Labels


	Under "evlConfig", you can add zone labels to the zone information (primarily when using 
	eventAsJSONTopic functionality):
		"zoneInfo": {
			"<zoneId>": { "label": "My textual zone label" },
		(ex.)	"1": { "label": "Livingroom" }
		}
